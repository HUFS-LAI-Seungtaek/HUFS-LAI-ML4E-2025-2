But one job category bore the brunt of cuts more than others: engineers.</p> <p>Documents filed in New York, California, New Jersey and Amazon’s home state of Washington showed that nearly 40% of the more than 4,700 job cuts in those states were engineering roles. The data was reported by Amazon in Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification, or WARN, filings to state agencies.</p> <p>The figures represent a segment of the total layoffs announced in October. Not all data was immediately available because of differences in state WARN reporting requirements.</p> <p>In announcing the steepest round of cuts in its 31-year history, Amazon joined a growing roster of tech companies that have slashed jobs this year even as cash piles have mounted and profits soared. In total, there have been almost 113,000 job cuts at 231 tech companies, according to Layoffs.fyi, continuing a trend that began in 2022 as businesses readjusted to life after the Covid pandemic.</p> <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has been on a multiyear mission to transform the company’s corporate culture into one that operates like what he calls “the world’s largest startup.” He’s looked to make Amazon leaner and less bureaucratic by urging staffers to do more with less and cutting organizational bloat.</p> <p>Amazon is expected to carry out further job reductions in January, CNBC previously reported.</p> <p>The company said it’s also shifting resources to invest more in artificial intelligence. The technology is already poised to reshape Amazon’s white-collar workforce, with Jassy predicting in June that its corporate head count will shrink in the coming years alongside efficiency gains from AI.</p> <p>Human resources chief Beth Galetti, in her memo announcing the layoffs, focused on the importance of innovating, which the company will now have to do with fewer people, specifically engineers.</p> <p>“This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before,” Galetti wrote. “We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.”</p> <p>Amazon said in a statement that AI is not the driver behind the vast majority of the job cuts, and that the bigger goal was to reduce bureaucracy and emphasize speed.</p> <p>Jassy said on Amazon’s earnings call last month that the cuts were in response to a “culture” issue inside the company, spurred in part by an extended hiring spree that left it with “a lot more layers” and slower decision-making.</p> <p>The layoffs impacted a mix of software engineer levels, but SDE II roles, or mid-level employees, were disproportionately affected, the WARN filings show.</p> <p>The AI boom is making software development jobs harder to come by as companies adopt coding assistants or so-called vibe coding platforms from vendors like Cursor, OpenAI and Cognition. Amazon has released its own competitor called Kiro.</p> <p>Source: <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/21/amazon-cut-thousands-of-engineers-in-its-record-layoffs-filings-show.html"">https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/21/amazon-cut-thousands-of-engineers-in-its-record-layoffs-filings-show.html</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/Puginator""> /u/Puginator </a> <br/> <span><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1p36301/amazon_cut_1800_engineers_in_its_record_layoffs/"">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1p36301/amazon_cut_1800_engineers_in_its_record_layoffs/"">[comments]</a></span>",0,0,1763749147.0,2025-11-21 18:19:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1p36301/amazon_cut_1800_engineers_in_its_record_layoffs/

This low cash level, as tracked by Bank of America&#39;s Fund Manager Survey (FMS), is often interpreted as a &quot;sell signal&quot; because it indicates stretched risk-taking and high investor optimism.

Usually a large complex and destructive fire requiring many resources. They had previously thought to resume production at the plant from a three alarm fire from September in December. But this sounds pretty damaging by the scale of it. The previous downtime from the September fire was estimated to cost Ford $1.5-$2 billion in production loss. They also supply other automotive companies and have the added perk of not being tariffed due to being a domestic supplier, although they have production in 11 countries internationally.</p> <p>While the damage hasn’t been assessed yet, the fire took 9 hours to put out. Any other fellow Ford investors worried about how this may affect production? I’m guessing they’ll just pay more to purchase capacity from other providers, or slow or halt production for the plant(s) that were being supplied by the Oswego site.

Short potential?"" title=""MSNT (Monster Energy Drink) Overvalued?! Short potential?"" /> </a> </td><td> <!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Good afternoon guys, I found a goldmine.</p> <p>Monster energy drink has reached an all time high, but why? Who actually drinks Monsters? Wife beaters (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/shorts/RibEPALlVE4"">https://www.youtube.com/shorts/RibEPALlVE4</a>). With tariffs and manufacturing located outside of the country, there is a strong possibility of next quarter being a total failure. Just look at coke, they have their next earning priced accordingly. But Monster is going to outperform them, on what basis? Ok ok ok, I know what you might be telling yourself, you&#39;re cooked, ur r-tarted, u dont know what your talking about. Let me take you through the second greatest DD of WallStreetBets. </p> <p><strong>Quant Analysis:</strong></p> <p>Tell me, does anything look different? Yeah you can tell, the quant analysts coming up with the projected earnings for monster are either interns or asleep because they are getting them wrong AF (see Q4 FY24 as example). So what is going to happen when the projected earnings for Monster take a nose dive with other consumer defensive stocks like KO. It&#39;s going to TANK. And with a 41 pe compared to KO’s 25 you can see why this monster is ready to burst. If those aren&#39;t enough to convince you, maybe morningstar rating monsters at 1 star quant and 2 star business analysis should. Not to mention that most of the people drinking energy drinks also work jobs like IT and programming. So if you believe that AI is going to reduce the workforce AT ALL, you would also expect that the forward looking revenue/earnings for monsters would stagnate or simply decrease.</p> <p><strong>Who drinks Monster?</strong></p> <p>Let’s think about it for one sec. Who have you actually seen drink this crap? People with shit jobs or disgusting teens. With over 60% of sales occurring in America and a strong likelihood of job losses over the next few months with government worker cuts/AI taking over/tariffs, this company will tank hard. Their main consumers will lose their jobs or will be struggling for cash. </p> <p><strong>It’s all marketing</strong></p> <p>Monster is just a logo (an ugly one too). They are burning money to keep this company alive. With UFC and other sports leeching off of this thing, they will burn a hole in their balance sheet before they can beat upcoming competition like Celcius which has been booming over the past couple of years. It is a battle they are not ready to compete in. They will slowly start bleeding with new up and comers and drown in their own debt. </p> <p><strong>Health trends (Ozempic?)</strong></p> <p>Let’s be real. Everyone is transitioning into health matters. The water trend we have been seeing and increase in ozempic intake is off the charts. Guys like RFK are pushing this health bs that will kill energy drink companies in general. Monster is just in a weak position. The only bull statement morningstar could put into its 2 STAR rating was that monster was making sugar free drinks. A company built on sugary drinks that were meant to sponsor sports (ummmm redbull much). These guys are scammers. Are you going to get fooled by them too? Take advantage of their weak position and short this dawg shit company. </p> <p><strong>Recent news with feminist drinks</strong></p> <p>Look at this shit: <a href=""https://www.fooddive.com/news/monster-launching-energy-drink-women-alani-nu-competitor/805779/"">https://www.fooddive.com/news/monster-launching-energy-drink-women-alani-nu-competitor/805779/</a> These guys are grasping at straws. A feminist energy drink?! Who gives a flying fuck. Not the consumer. THey want to be DEI but also catter to loser gamer guys that could give less of a fuck. Ive never seen a women drink a monster and this campaign wont change that. I could go on and on on their bs marketing schemes over the years but i could give less of fuck to go find these dawg shit articles. YOu find them if you are so keen on seeing this crap. </p> <p><strong>Who carries the product?</strong></p> <p>Grocery stores and convenient stores, thats it. Redbull owns the market outside of those worlds. Clubs, events, arenas, you name it. Its all Redbull. They won the marketing game. Monster is only surviving in one domain, take that away from them and what are they? NOthing. They will die of thirst with what is to come. They have one product, one logo, one vibe, one everything. The brand was a trend, ill give them that. They made their money but they are slowly on their way out. <strong>You</strong> can be the guys who saw it coming. <strong>You</strong> can be the guy who said “I told you so”. <strong>YOu</strong> can be the guy that made millions of a bet that no one was talking about. </p> <p>This shit is a bigger ripoff than private equity. With all these fears of the AI bubble people have been missing the big consumer defensive bubble forming from grocery companies charging us overpriced eggs and SHIT. So if you want to show these companies that you can&#39;t treat us like garbage, it&#39;s time to grab your pitchforks and put options and show these monsters THAT THEY CAN&#39;T KEEP RIPPING US OFF. </p> <p>If you think im wrong then buy some calls you fucking pussy.</p> <p><strong>Current position:</strong> </p> <p>I bought 10k in puts for 6 months on a strike price of 67 LOL im going to be fucking RICH.</p> <p>MSNT loses 12-18% of its market in the next 6 months. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/weird5""> /u/weird5 </a> <br/> <span><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p3icg3"">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1p3icg3/msnt_monster_energy_drink_overvalued_short/"">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>",0,0,1763780225.0,2025-11-22 02:57:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1p3icg3/msnt_monster_energy_drink_overvalued_short/

AMPX DD"" /> </a> </td><td> <!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Given everyone is bearish around here and is butthurt about seeing their positions crater over the last month, let me try and inject some good old fashioned DD so you can fantasize about future gains again. This will be a long one as I’ve been following this company for quite a while and done a fair amount of research on the sector. Writing to share but also looking for feedback from anyone who has been on the front lines. (If you fly drones for the army please hit me up) Here we go:</p> <p>The Red Queen Hypothesis and Unfair Advantages</p> <p>I used to work as an engineer in a highly competitive (but also technical) sport. It’s where I witnessed how powerful the Red Queen hypothesis is. In evolutionary biology, the Red Queen hypothesis proposes that organisms must constantly adapt and evolve just to maintain their current fitness in a rapidly changing environment. In sport, this means that every new piece of equipment that confers an advantage eventually becomes table stakes. In business, the metaphor fits companies that offer a technology to a hyper-competitive industry that is seen as an “unfair advantage”. Those that don’t adopt fast enough get left behind. Ten baggers are the companies that create and embed an advantage so powerful that their technology becomes necessary rather than optional for survival in the competitive arena.</p> <p>Think about NVDA and the AI arms race:</p> <p>A company builds a technology that rivals cannot easily replicate and that customers must adopt to keep up.</p> <p>Over time, keeping up becomes, in effect, the bare minimum and those who lag pay a price (either margin pressure, share loss or extinction).</p> <p>The industry’s motion forces everyone to “run faster” just to stay in place; the “winner” runs ahead and thus outpaces everyone else, like the Red Queen’s race.</p> <p>For shareholders, this dynamic can produce sustained growth, margin expansion and ultimately multi-bag returns when the market begins to price in the inevitability of dominance.</p> <p>To use this as a filter for finding a potential “next NVDA,” one should ask:</p> <p>Is the company offering a true step-change technological advantage?</p> <p>Is the advantage serving a high-stakes, high-volume industry where the cost of not adopting is meaningful?</p> <p>Are there structural tailwinds (regulatory, geopolitical, market) that make adoption likely and widespread?</p> <p>Are there barriers to entry (patents, manufacturing scale, regulatory approvals, systems integration)?</p> <p>Can the company transition from early-proof to scale production to cash-flow positive?</p> <p>When these align, the company and its products shift from nice to have must have, and if you can time the inflection, the upside can be dramatic.</p> <p>Why I think this is where AMPX (Amprius Technologies, Inc.) and the Drone Market stand today</p> <p>Let’s walk through how AMPX fits this Red Queen model, focusing on the drone / unmanned aerial systems (UAS) sector, which is undergoing a structural shift.</p> <p>Unfair advantage: high-energy-density silicon-anode batteries Amprius has developed silicon-anode lithium-ion cells (its SiCore® platform) that deliver very high energy density (cited at ~450 Wh/kg) and are shipping to drone / UAS customers. The advantage: for drones, endurance, power-to-weight ratio, reliability in demanding environments all matter. A battery that lets a drone fly longer, carry more, or operate in harsher conditions becomes a competitive differentiator.</p> <p>To give you a practical sense of how much of an advantage these batteries are: Nordic Wing (a recently announced customer) claimed that these batteries increased flight time by 90%. Nearly double. If you’ve ever flown a drone: flight time is a major limitation and a doubling is an unfair advantage.</p> <p>The thesis: If military/commercial drone OEMs adopt Amprius’ cells as a required component to stay competitive (i.e., “we must use this battery tech or our drone cannot keep up”), then Amprius may be in a position to become a “must-supplier” in a fast-moving industry.</p> <p>Industry: drones / defence procurement is entering a leap</p> <p>Lots has been written about drones on WSB so I won’t go too deep into the industry details. I would only go into one headline that you may have missed because you were too busy mourning your ports:</p> <p>The United States Army recently announced that it is targeting procurement of at least one million drones over the next 2-3 years compared to its current rate of ~50 000/year. This is not the “10-20% CAGR” that analysts have been modeling. This is a tenfold increase. </p> <p>The drone industry is not just growing, but entering a step-change in scale and procurement behaviour. In such environments, component suppliers that supply the “secret sauce” tech (like high-density batteries) can benefit disproportionately.</p> <p>Fit: Amprius meets the criteria AMPX is shipping cells to advanced drone customers and already qualified some of its modules for leading defense tech.</p> <p>The company claims partnerships and orders from UAS manufacturers (e.g., a recent ~$35 million follow-on purchase order from a drone customer). </p> <p>The tech has meaningful performance claims (450 Wh/kg, long-endurance drones) that allow drone makers to differentiate. </p> <p>The addressable market is large and rising, and procurement cycles are shifting from “nice” to “need.”</p> <p>Because the advantage is embedded in a complex hardware component (battery chemistry + manufacturing scale + safety + certification) it is harder to replicate quickly.</p> <p>Where the “Red Queen” effect kicks in Drone OEMs and militaries are under pressure: adversaries are using expendable drones, swarms, long-duration UAS, etc. To keep up, incumbents must adopt superior batteries, sensors, autonomy, etc. Amprius’ tech thus becomes not just a bonus, but potentially part of the minimum standard to compete. That means the company might avoid being just another supplier and instead become a foundational supplier: giving it leverage on pricing, margins and volume.</p> <p>If the transition from “prototype” to “volume orders” happens (and Amprius seems to be making that move), then the stock might see the kind of multi-bag move one hopes for when the market re-rates based on future dominance.</p> <p>BuT tHe sToCK Is AlrEAdY uP:</p> <p>Yes, yes, the stock has run. I actually tried to post about it late last year but it was under the allowable market cap. This is a real company: and real companies can continue to go up if earnings back it up. Here are some numbers to back valuations:</p> <p>Q3 2025 (ended Sept 30) revenue: $21m. EPS of –$0.03 vs –$0.06 estimate. </p> <p>Growth: This was a ~42% quarter-on-quarter increase and ~173% year-over-year (for the quarter) Gross margin: The company has reported a positive gross margin ( +15% in Q3) that is expected to expand Orders/customers: A ~$35 million order from a recurring drone customer. 80 customers added in Q3 and $53m in backlog orders.</p> <p>Production capacity: The firm has stated ~1.8 gigawatt hours of capacity through partners. This translates to $1-2B of revenue at full capacity. </p> <p>Conservative profitability scenario: Let’s assume the following:</p> <p>Revenue for full year 2026 grows, not exponentially, but moderately (say ~100% vs 2025). If 2025 full-year revenue ends up around ~$75m (given Q1-Q3 numbers and ramp), then 2026 might hit ~$140-200m in revenue. At say a 15% gross margin (which is already achieved and is expected to expand), and modest operating expense growth, the company could move from net loss to near breakeven or modest profit. In Q1 or Q2 2026.</p> <p>Given the order backlog and ramp in drone battery shipments, the margin expansion may happen without assuming extraordinary growth.</p> <p>In other words: if the market begins to believe that Amprius can deliver $150m+ revenue with 15%+ gross margin, then the path to profitability seems credible and that tends to shift the valuation multiple upward (especially for a “must-supplier” in a fast growth market). Even if the company is not free-cash-flow positive today, the market will begin to treat it as more than an R&amp;D story. </p> <p>Risks: standard and obvious. Company is not profitable yet. (It has also been stuck in a momentum basket which has made it quite volatile, though it seems to be losing tracking now)</p> <p>Summary &amp; PT</p> <p>Without getting too deep into the numbers: having been on earnings calls and seen analyst PTs and modeling a small increase in growth, my 2026 PT is $25. (This is a tenbagger from when I first got in, sorry) though I’ve added at $7 and again at $11. There is no reason, should they continue to execute, that AMPX can’t be a 5-10B company.</p> <p>Position attached plus another 2k shares in an account I can’t see online (you’ll have to take my word for it)</p> <p>Putting it all together: The Red Queen lens tells us: look for companies whose advantage becomes a baseline “must have” in a fast-moving market.</p> <p>Amprius appears to fit: high-density silicon-anode batteries, serving drone/UAS manufacturers in an environment where drones are rapidly becoming indispensable.</p> <p>Macro tailwinds are strong: military procurement of drones is ramping (US Army, executive orders, etc), the global drone market is growing, domestic supply-chain shifts favour US-based component providers. Personally, on a macro level, I think monetary and fiscal policy will be pro-risk asset in the beginning of 2026 as well.</p> <p>If the market begins to price in that Amprius will be the dominant supplier (or among the few key suppliers) to the drone industry, then the valuation upside could be meaningful. The key is timing the inflection from “growth story” to “earnings story” once profitability (or credible path to profitability) is visible, the multiple expansion often follows.</p> <p>Hang in there, and see you in Valhalla.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/batteryboner""> /u/batteryboner </a> <br/> <span><a href=""https://i.redd.it/ziemqbe6on2g1.jpeg"">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1p36q7u/anatomy_of_a_tenbagger_why_the_red_queen/"">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>",0,0,1763750636.0,2025-11-21 18:43:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1p36q7u/anatomy_of_a_tenbagger_why_the_red_queen/

Let’s Talk About Stop-Loss Triggers During Daily Volatility.,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I’ve been observing something that feels… off. And the more I look at it, the more it seems like the entire trading system is tilted against regular investors. Every day the market has an opening price and a closing price. That’s what the media reports:</p> <p>“SPY closed up today.” “NASDAQ finished green.”</p> <p>Great. But here’s the problem:</p> <p>During the trading session, prices swing like crazy, massive volatility, algo-driven moves, liquidity traps, stop hunts… you name it. Meanwhile, retail investors who use stop-losses can get knocked out of their positions right in the middle of the volatility, even if by the end of the day the market finishes up. So you can literally buy a strong stock, get stopped out by intraday manipulation/noise/algos/liquidity gaps… only for the stock to recover and close green. You lose, institutions win.</p> <p>Why does the system even function like this?</p> <p>Wouldn’t a fairer system be: Stop-losses only trigger at the closing price, when all investors, retail and institutional are on the same playing field?</p> <p>Instead of punishing people during random intraday spikes created by big money?</p> <p>Right now it feels like the rules are set up to sweep retail investors out of positions, harvest liquidity and then let the market rally without them. Am I missing something here, or is the trading system intentionally structured to exploit volatility against retail?

Are there any trends? John Marshall: So the first and most important one is in the ETF market. This represents the buy-and-hold investor. Investors who are intending to buy a very broad basket of stocks and hold onto it for a long period of time. They have been buying a lot this year. 350 billion in inflows into these ETFs, individual investor ETFs. And this is even better than in 2021 when we had 300 billion of inflows. The other area where they&#39;re doing significant buying is in single stocks. So single-stock shares of individual stocks. This is more like a medium-term investor, and they&#39;re picking themes. A lot of, of course, AI in this flavor of investor. And we&#39;ve seen five times the amount of NASDAQ 100 buying this year as compared to 2021. So that particular theme is really coming out in the data as accelerating.</p> <p>Chris Hussey: Is the retail trend your friend? Should you be following this or fading them? John Marshall: It&#39;s a great question. A lot of people like to think of it as a contrarian indicator. Okay, retail is really hot on a particular stock or sector, so that&#39;s a sell signal. We find that is not true. You generally want to be following this cohort of investor and monitoring their enthusiasm level.</p> <p>Chris Hussey: Another observation that you&#39;ve made in the past has been that retail investors are very active in options and even single-stock options. So, you know, walk us through a little bit about this. John Marshall: Yeah, the options activity is particularly interesting because this is the short-term investor. The average single-stock option has only two weeks to expiration, so all of this activity really relates to expectations within the next two weeks. There&#39;s been a lot of call buying. And in particular in 2025 we&#39;ve seen about 420 billion notional of options trade per day. This is a little bit less than in 2021 when the meme craze was on, but it&#39;s still a really high level. And it shows you how much anticipation there is of short-term moves in the market.</p> <p>I&#39;d say what people have actively been doing to really monetize some of these retail activity over the last few years has been option-selling strategies. So the dominant retail trade is buying calls and buying puts. Buying puts to protect their portfolio, and buying calls in order to gain upside asymmetric exposure to stocks. That bids up options on both sides, and strategies that sell those options to generate income have added benefit in this type of environment. And in particular, there are a lot of bondholders out there that are looking at yields and thinking, &quot;Ah, these yields, I really want more than the bonds can give me.&quot; And so what they&#39;re doing is moving into defensive, high-income equity products that sell these options. We&#39;ve seen about 30 billion in inflows over the last year into ETFs and mutual funds that sell options to generate yield, and they&#39;re relatively defensive.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/Guy_PCS""> /u/Guy_PCS </a> <br/> <span><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1p3985k/goldman_sachs_the_markets_rise_of_the_retail/"">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1p3985k/goldman_sachs_the_markets_rise_of_the_retail/"">[comments]</a></span>",0,0,1763756482.0,2025-11-21 20:21:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1p3985k/goldman_sachs_the_markets_rise_of_the_retail/

My take-home pay is around 40k a year, so I keep things simple with automatic transfers of 100 dollars a month, focusing on low fees and long-term growth without day trading or risky stocks. As I read more about retirement options, I opened a Roth IRA because contributions are after-tax, and withdrawals are tax-free later, which seems good for someone like me who might end up in a higher tax bracket down the road from career growth or inflation.</p> <p>One worry I had was about required minimum distributions from traditional accounts forcing taxes in old age, so I tried out a <a href=""https://q3adv.com/"">helpful financial tool</a> with an RMD calculator that showed me projections on how much I&#39;d have to pull out yearly after 73 and the tax hit based on different savings levels. It helped me see that converting even small amounts to Roth now could cut future taxes without big upfront costs, especially since my current bracket is low. I ran numbers assuming 6 percent annual returns over 40 years, and it estimated saving a few thousand in taxes by avoiding RMD penalties or bracket jumps, which made me think about starting small conversions from a rollover IRA I have from an old part-time gig.</p> <p>Now I&#39;m wondering if this makes sense for total beginners or if I should just max the Roth contributions first before conversions. Has anyone here in their 20s done early Roth conversions and noticed real benefits over time?

If we delivered a great quarter, we are fueling the AI bubble,” he told employees. “If we were off by just a hair, if it looked even a little bit creaky, the whole world would’ve fallen apart.”</p> <p>The comments offer a rare glimpse into how the face of the AI boom views the growing backlash to it, and how closely he is watching the market’s whiplash response. A blowout quarter that spooked investors</p> <p>On paper, Nvidia gave investors about everything they had asked for. The chipmaker reported another surge in sales of its data-center processors, the workhorses that power large AI models (and Nvidia’s revenues), and raised its guidance for the current quarter. It was the kind of performance expected to kick off another six-month rally, investors were saying. </p> <p>Instead, the stock’s initial jump gave way to a broad selloff. Nvidia climbed as much as 5% early in Thursday’s session before closing down roughly 3%, as traders rotated out of the Big Tech names most closely associated with the AI boom. </p> <p>The reversal extended what has become a bruising stretch for the so-called AI trade. After months of a breathless rally, investors are increasingly anxious that tech giants are spending too aggressively on data centers, GPUs, and networking gear, with no guarantee they can earn enough revenue to get those investments back. Some are also focusing on the complex, debt-heavy financing structures behind the AI infrastructure build-out, with credit markets starting to flash early warning signs.</p> <p>Layered on top of that are fresh macro jitters. A shutdown-delayed U.S. jobs report, released the same morning, showed stronger-than-expected hiring in September, but a higher unemployment rate; this conflicting data did little to clarify whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in December.</p> <p>Some investors are closely watching different statements from Fed presidents to try to read the tea leaves, but with the earnings season winding down and no obvious catalyst between now and the Fed’s next decision, it appears that many other investors are using the volatility to lock in profits from the year’s earlier rally—and get out of the market.</p> <p>“The broader narrative hasn’t broken; it’s simply being tested right now,” Mark Hackett at Nationwide told Bloomberg. “Periods like this often act as a release valve rather than signaling a true trend reversal. ‘We’re basically holding the planet together‘</p> <p>Inside Nvidia, Huang suggested no one should be surprised that investors are jumpy when so much of the AI story is being projected onto a single company.</p> <p>He referenced online memes that jokingly describe Nvidia as the linchpin of the global economy and <strong>the only thing standing between the U.S. and recession</strong>.</p> <p>“Have you guys seen some of them?” he asked employees. “We’re basically holding the planet together—and it’s not untrue.”</p> <p>That level of mythos has helped propel Nvidia’s market value into the stratosphere, making it the world’s most valuable public company. But Huang made clear that it has also turned every earnings day into a high-wire act.</p> <p>“The expectations are so high that if we miss by just a little bit, people think the whole story is broken,” he said.</p> <p>Still, Huang pushed back on the idea that Nvidia is responsible for the frothier parts of the AI trade. The company’s job, he emphasized, is to build the compute infrastructure others need, not to police how the market prices demand.</p> <p>Amidst the pressure, Huang kept the meeting light with whistling-past-the-graveyard-esqe humor about Nvidia’s wild swings.</p> <p>He joked about the “good old days” when the company had a $5 trillion market capitalization, a playful exaggeration of its actual peak valuation—before noting just how much value has evaporated in recent weeks.</p> <p>“Nobody in history has ever lost $500 billion in a few weeks,” he said. “You’ve got to be worth a lot to lose $500 billion in a few weeks.”</p> <p>Huang told employees he was “delighted” by the quarter and proud of their work, stressing the company’s underlying business remains strong even if markets are punishing them for it.</p> </blockquote> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/Prudent-Corgi3793""> /u/Prudent-Corgi3793 </a> <br/> <span><a href=""https://fortune.com/2025/11/21/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-q3-earnings-beat-no-win-situation-ai-bubble-fears-nvda-stock-selloff/"">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1p3drri/fortune_nvidia_ceo_says_the_company_is_in_a_nowin/"">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>",0,0,1763767514.0,2025-11-21 23:25:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1p3drri/fortune_nvidia_ceo_says_the_company_is_in_a_nowin/

The idea? Maximizing Bitcoin per share for shareholders and acting as a proxy for investors who ordinarily can not gain exposure to the digital asset.</p> <p>Schiff’s remarks come as Strategy has increasingly turned to preferreds rather than common stock for capital raises in recent months. The shift comes as the company’s premium to net asset value has contracted significantly, making it difficult to issue equity to fund new Bitcoin purchases without diluting shareholders. The metric has fallen from over 2.5 to less than 1 in the past year.</p> <p>The contraction has coincided with an explosion of copycat companies in recent months. According to Bitcoin Treasuries, there are now 194 companies with Bitcoin on their balance sheet. </p> <p>Beyond the rise of copycats, Strategy has faced additional pressure from Bitcoin’s market slide in the past month, from a price record of $126,000 to as low as $89,000 on Tuesday.</p> <p>While preferred stocks enable Strategy to continue accumulating Bitcoin in the face of such headwinds, the company lacks significant cash flow, which means dividends to old investors would be paid from capital raised from new investors, which raises red flags for some. </p> <p>The company had nearly $700 million in annual dividend obligations as of Q3.</p> <p>“We wouldn’t miss a single dividend payment on an 80% drawdown,” Saylor said in Strategy’s Q2 earnings call at the end of July.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/Burnned_User""> /u/Burnned_User </a> <br/> <span><a href=""https://www.benzinga.com/personal-finance/management/25/11/49009770/strategys-entire-business-model-is-a-fraud-gold-bug-peter-schiff-challenges-michael-saylor-to-a-debate?utm_source=SmartNews&amp;amp;utm_campaign=partner_feed&amp;amp;utm_medium=partner_feed&amp;amp;utm_content=site"">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1p385hm/strategys_entire_business_model_is_a_fraud_gold/"">[comments]</a></span>",0,0,1763753920.0,2025-11-21 19:38:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1p385hm/strategys_entire_business_model_is_a_fraud_gold/

A Moving Average is a good way to gauge momentum as well as to confirm trends, and define areas of support and resistance. Essentially, Moving Averages smooth out the “noise” when trying to interpret charts. Noise is made up of fluctuations of both price and volume. Because a Moving Average is a lagging indicator and reacts to events that have already happened, it is not used as a predictive indicator but rather an interpretive one, used for confirmations and analysis.</p> <p>Simple Moving Average is an unweighted Moving Average. This means that each day in the data set has equal importance and is weighted equally. As each new day ends, the oldest data point is dropped and the newest one is added to the beginning.</p> <p>It must be taken into account that, while SMA helps filter out the noise and see the general direction in which the symbol has been moving, it is also slow to react to newer changes. The higher the SMA length is, the longer it will take for a major price change to be notably reflected in it.</p> <p>---</p> <p>About S&amp;P 500 Index</p> <p>Standard and Poor&#39;s 500 Index is a capitalization-weighted stock market index measuring the performance of 500 large publicly traded companies in the United States. This index covers a wide range of industries, including technology, healthcare, energy, and finance. It serves as a benchmark for the overall health of the U.S. stock market, as well as a reflection of the country&#39;s economic strength.<br/> Substantial gains in the S&amp;P 500 are often interpreted as positive signals for the economy, while losses can be seen as indicators of potential trouble. Investors use this index as a barometer for their own portfolios and to assess the performance of individual stocks. The S&amp;P 500 index plays a vital role in the financial world and is closely watched by analysts and policymakers.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/Previous_Cod_1356""> /u/Previous_Cod_1356 </a> <br/> <span><a href=""https://i.redd.it/ou419lvj6k2g1.png"">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1p2s99e/spx_has_broken_below_the_100_day_simple_moving/"">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>",0,0,1763709596.0,2025-11-21 07:19:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1p2s99e/spx_has_broken_below_the_100_day_simple_moving/

Here&#39;s a very quick and very conservative calculation: Assuming <strong>net margin stay the same</strong> and <strong>no growth</strong> in revenue, then BILI will have a <strong>TTM EPS of $0.98 same time next year</strong>!</p> <p>But of course, that&#39;s not gonna happen, because unlike gaming, the video and ads business is much more reliable. BILI is arguably one of the only company in China with monopoly power (long form user generated videos, just like Youtube). As a result, <strong>there will be predictable revenue growth and continued margin expansion</strong>. <strong>The real TTM EPS in a year is more likely to be in the range of $1.5</strong>.</p> <p>I&#39;m not saying that the stock is going to double or triple, but I&#39;m buying options assuming so: After selling all the options when the price was above 30, before the earnings report, I now just bought $30k worth of options, break even at about $35 and expire in a year. If, by some miracle, the stock price continue to dip, I&#39;ll sell some stock to continue buying BILI options.</p> <p>Ps. As always when discuss Chinese stock: yes, I&#39;m aware of the China risk. That&#39;s why I&#39;m buying in the HK stock exchange. However, please remember, China has no inflation at the moment, and they have plenty of room for fiscal and monetary stimulus.
